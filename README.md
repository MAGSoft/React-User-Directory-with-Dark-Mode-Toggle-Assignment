# MERN Stack Assignment

## Overview

Welcome to the MERN stack assignment! This evaluation is designed to assess your knowledge and skills in the MERN stack, focusing on coding and Logical skills. You will be working on a mini project that will help us understand your approach to problem-solving, programming, and system design.

## Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone the assignment repository provided to you by GitHub Classroom.

2. **Install dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Sample Solution**: In this repository, you will find a sample solution that demonstrates what your final implementation should look like. Please review the sample_code.js, sample_test.js, and sample_output.txt files to understand the structure and requirements of the assignment.

4. **Develop your solution**: Implement your solution using React, following the guidelines and requirements provided in the assignment. Make sure to write clean, efficient, and modular code that adheres to best practices.

5. **Testing**: Write test cases using the React Testing Library and Jest to ensure the correctness of your implementation. Use the provided sample_test.js file as a reference for writing your test cases. Writing test cases is not compulsory, but if you write them, it will be considered a plus point.

6. **Submit your assignment**: Once you have completed the implementation and testing, commit your changes and push your code to the GitHub Classroom repository.

## Evaluation Criteria
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

- Correctness and functionality of your implementation
- Code quality, including readability, modularity, and adherence to best practices
- Test coverage and the quality of test cases
- Overall design and architecture of your solution

## Notes

- The sample solution is provided for reference only. You should not modify the contents of this folder or use the sample code directly in your own solution.
- While working on the assignment, try to develop your own approach to the problem and do not rely on the sample solution as a template.
- Remember to follow the instructions and requirements outlined in the main `README.md` file of the assignment repository.

Good luck with the assignment, and feel free to reach out to the us if you have any questions or concerns!
