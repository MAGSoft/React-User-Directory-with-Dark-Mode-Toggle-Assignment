# React User Directory with Dark Mode Toggle Task

## Objective    
The objective of this task is to assess the intern's React knowledge and understanding, including the implementation of API fetching, data rendering, and context API usage.

## Task Description
You are required to create a React application that fetches data from the Random User API and displays a user directory. The application should have the following features:

- Use functional components and hooks.
- Fetch user data from the Random User API using Axios.
- Display the fetched user data in a user directory format, including their names, addresses, email addresses, and profile pictures.
- Implement a dark mode toggle button that allows the user to switch between light and dark mode.
- Use the Context API to manage the application's theme (light/dark mode).

### Task Details
- Fetch data from the Random User API using Axios. The API documentation can be found [here](https://randomuser.me/documentation).
- Implement the user directory component that displays the fetched user data in a clean and organized manner.
- Create a dark mode toggle button that allows the user to switch between light and dark mode. Use the Context API to manage the theme.
- Ensure proper error handling for API requests and display error messages when necessary.
- Organize your code, keeping it clean and readable.
- Implement the UI using appropriate styling frameworks or libraries (e.g., CSS, Bootstrap, Material-UI, etc.) to enhance the user experience.
